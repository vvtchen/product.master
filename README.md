## A sales observation and inventory management system that can help multiple small e-commerce owners optimize their sales and purchase.

This project has user authentication which will make business data safe, only people invited by the register account can access the data. Users can easily observe each product’s sales performance, inventory condition, optimize restocking strategy, and track their incoming purchase orders.

- Use JSON web token to verify users. Users can register for their organization and give permission to people they want to share business data with. People without your invitation can’t view your data.
- User registered on the system will create their own data, only users who have your invitation can access your data.
- Each product’s information will include its detail, sales chart, inventory level, price, price margin, price ROI, and history of sales performance.
- Users can add quantities to the shopping cart on the product page. Each product has three different shopping carts and allow users to plan their future restocking orders and maximize the product’s profit by preventing overstock or out-of-stock.
- Includes overall company dashboard which will have overall sales chart, margin, GMS, total purchase amount, inventory status, and profit.
- Each vendor has their own dashboard page, this page will include a sales chart, margin, GMS, top 10 products, inventory status, and purchase status which can support users to make strategies for a specific vendor.
- Includes a product filter function that will allow users to find products by inventory level, current price margin, ROI, product tags, and products that have sales between a specific date.
- Includes invoice verify function that will support users to identify the difference between invoice and corresponding purchase order.
- Includes existing purchase order page that will show the status of the purchase order which supports users to track their purchase orders status.
- Users can import their products, sales, and invoice information by the xlsx template provided on the upload page.
